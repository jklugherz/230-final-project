# 230-final-project

For my final project in Wellesley's CS 230 Data Structures class, I, along with two other students, built a Java GUI that plans the sequence in which a user should complete their daily tasks based on the time it will take to complete, the due date, and personal priority. When a user inputs a task, its weight is calculated based on these factors and is inserted into a LinkedList of tasks based on the weight value.

We also implemented LinkedBinaryTree to display a personalized motivational quote depending on the user's answer to questions pertaining to mood and stress level. 

For more details and images of the interface, open "My Very Own GUI Life Coach.pdf" in this repository.
