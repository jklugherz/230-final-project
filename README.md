# 230-final-project

For my final project in Wellesley's CS 230 Data Structures class, I, along with two other students, built a Java GUI that plans the sequence in which a user should complete their daily tasks. This sequence is based on the time it will take to complete, the due date, and personal priority. When a user inputs a task, our program calculates its weight based on these factors and inserts the task into a LinkedList of tasks. The task's location in the LinkedList is dependent on the calculated weight value.

We also implemented LinkedBinaryTree to display a personalized motivational quote depending on the user's answer to questions pertaining to mood and stress level. 

For more details and images of the interface, open "My Very Own GUI Life Coach.pdf" in this repository.
