1. Sara - I wrote the ToDoList class, the underlying class that interacts with the GUI. 
I also wrote the SchedulePanel. 

2. Andjela - I wrote the Quotes class, WelcomePanel, InputTasks with Julia and assisted with the writing of MotivatePanel.

3. Julia - I wrote the Task class, the InputTasks panel, wrote most of the MotivatePanel,
 and edited Quotes so that its methods could be used in MotivatePanel.
